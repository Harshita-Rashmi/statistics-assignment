    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To summarize and describe the features of a dataset.\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "- Organizes and simplifies raw data\n",
    "- Uses measures like mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation\n",
    "- Visualizes data using charts, tables, histograms, box plots\n",
    "Example: Suppose you collect the test scores of 100 students:\n",
    "scores = [78, 85, 92, 88, 76, 95, 89, 84, 91, 87]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might calculate:\n",
    "- Mean score: sum(scores)/len(scores) → 86.5\n",
    "- Median score: 87\n",
    "- Standard deviation: Measures how spread out the scores are\n",
    "You could also plot a histogram to visualize the distribution.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "What it does:\n",
    "- Uses probability theory to estimate population parameters\n",
    "- Performs hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis\n",
    "- Helps answer questions like: “Is this effect real or just due to chance?”\n",
    "Example: You survey 100 people about their coffee consumption and find that 60% drink coffee daily. You want to infer whether this holds true for the entire city.\n",
    "You might:\n",
    "- Construct a confidence interval (e.g., 60% ± 5%)\n",
    "- Perform a hypothesis test to see if coffee consumption differs by age group\n",

    "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset (sample) from a larger group (population) to analyze and draw conclusions about the whole.\n",
    "Since it's often impractical to study an entire population (due to time, cost, or accessibility), sampling helps us:\n",
    "- Estimate population parameters\n",
    "- Test hypotheses\n",
    "- Make predictions\n",

    "- Sampling is the process of selecting a subset from a population to analyze and draw conclusions about the whole.\n",
    "- It helps reduce cost, time, and effort while still providing meaningful insights.\n",
    "Random Sampling:\n",
    "- Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- Simple to implement but may miss key subgroups by chance.\n",
    "- Example: Picking 100 students randomly from a university list.\n",
    "Stratified Sampling:\n",
    "- Population is divided into distinct subgroups (strata) based on characteristics like gender, age, or department.\n",
    "- A random sample is taken from each stratum to ensure balanced representation.\n",
    "- Example: Selecting 50 males and 50 females from a student population.\n",

    "The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values.\n",

    "It represents the overall average and is widely used in quantitative analysis.\n",

    "2. Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "- If the number of values is odd, it is the central value.\n",

    "Example: For [10, 20, 30], Median = 20; for [10, 20, 30, 40], Median = (20+30)/2 = 25\n",
    "3. Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",

    " Importance of Measures of Central Tendency\n",
